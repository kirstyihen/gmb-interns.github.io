Hi Everyone! My name is Kirsty Ihenetu! I am a currently in the application process for a Data Science Summer Internship at Get Motivated Buddies! 
A little about me: I am a currently a rising senior at Barnard College double majoring in Computer Science and Psychology. In applying to GMB, I really wanted to work with large pools of data in a real world context. I have been exposed to data through my schoolwork, but I feel that seeing more realistic displays of data would deepen my appreciation for data science. Through this summer I am most excited to be able to strengthen my data science skills while also learning to tell stories with data. I feel that with such a unique company as GMB very powerful, impact narratives could be unlocked through data analysis. These narrative could enhance GMB's product and show the public the groundbreaking work that is being done at GMB.
